1. Unnecessary useMemo Dependency (prices)
Issue: The useMemo dependency array includes prices, but prices is not actually used within the memoized callback. This creates unnecessary recomputations of sortedBalances whenever prices change.
Improvement: Remove prices from the dependency array of useMemo.

2. Incorrect Filtering Logic
Issue: The filtering logic in balances.filter() is flawed. lhsPriority is undefined in the code, leading to a runtime error. Additionally, the condition balance.amount <= 0 returning true seems counterintuitive since it retains balances with zero or negative amounts.
Improvement: Use the correct variable (balancePriority), and clarify whether the intention is to exclude balances with non-positive amounts.

3. Redundant Computation of getPriority
Issue: getPriority is called multiple times in the sorting logic, which is computationally expensive since it involves multiple switch statement evaluations.
Improvement: Precompute priorities once and reuse them during filtering and sorting.

4. Inefficient Mapping of formattedBalances
Issue: The code first generates sortedBalances and then iterates over it to produce formattedBalances. This introduces an unnecessary intermediate step.
Improvement: Combine formattedBalances logic into the mapping process of rows to avoid the extra iteration.

5. Non-descriptive Props Interface
Issue: The Props interface extends BoxProps without specifying the purpose of WalletPage. This makes it harder to understand what props are expected.
Improvement: Clearly define the expected props in the Props interface.
